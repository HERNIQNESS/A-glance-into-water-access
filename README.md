Delivered clean water solutions: built taps, installed filters, and drilled wells.

Collaborated with decision-makers for effective budgeting and resource allocation.

##Impact

Over 50% of villagers gained access to improved water.

Built community trust through transparency and tangible results.

Created a scalable model for similar initiatives.

##Future Vision

Expand to other underserved communities.

Introduce real-time water monitoring systems.

Train local surveyors to ensure data integrity.
